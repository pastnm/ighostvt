/// as the drag passes over it (`dropEntered`, re-checked from
/// `dropUpdated` — a reorder slides rows under a pointer that never
/// crossed their edge, and the enter event alone missed those), so the
/// list reorders live and the drop itself only ends the gesture.
///
/// Built on `onDrag`/`onDrop` rather than `List.onMove` because neither
/// presentation is a `List`, and rather than `draggable`/`dropDestination`

/// a sidebar — a regular-width window, which a phone has too: the inner
/// display of a foldable, a large phone held sideways. The switcher's
/// cards reorder on the phone as well, where the long press that opens a
/// card's menu lifts it, and moving the finger then carries it.
